Spring Rolls now sell like crazy and nobody's interested in Prawn Salad (id 1) anymore. 
We need to change its name to something more exotic. Let's try Green Sea Dragon.

Apart from that, set the price at 10 to encourage customers to try the new old dish.

UPDATE dish
SET name = 'Green Sea Dragon', price = 10
WHERE id = 1
